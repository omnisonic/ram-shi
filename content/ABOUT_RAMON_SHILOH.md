 Ramon Shiloh
is an American award\-winning author, illustrator, activist, and multicultural
Chef of Black, Filipino, Creek, and Cherokee descent.

  

Born in Palo Alto California in the middle of the Occupation of Alcatraz 1970
he grew accompanying his mother, June ‘Sukuybtet’ Legrand, as she built friendships with countless
luminaries and communities of people.  As
a radio broadcaster, storyteller, educator, and social activist, his
mother surrounded him with Native perspectives and spiritual belief systems.  After his mother’s passing in 1992, Shiloh
picked up her mantle and dedicated himself to engagement in Native communities
where he remains devoted to this day; “this is simply our way of life”.

 

Shiloh has spent
his lifetime forging alliances throughout urban and rural environments.  He has volunteered at educationally focused
non\-profit organizations for over three decades as a writer, artist, and
instructor to create insights, extend knowledge, and expand distributable tools
related to the mediums of Art, Food Sovereignty, Writing, and the Spoken Word.  Shiloh’s capacity to relate to diverse
audiences, while maintaining and enhancing his cultural integrity, demonstrates
his words in action and completes the lessons for all those in which he invests.

 

In regard to
his dedication to Native and non\-Native youths Shiloh states, “As a mentor, I
want to help them identify the process, structure, and technique of Storytelling
in their everyday lives. Children have had a difficult run expressing
truthfully their fears, accomplishments, or dreams in a
socially\-awkward\-networked world. I want to guide them in trusting their
instincts and holding ownership of their actions.”   Utilizing this philosophy, he contributes
perspectives that help develop experience, knowledge, and their over\-arching
relationship\-to\-self to grow in authentic, individual, and unique expressions.

A
foundational achievement was born when Shiloh partnered as an illustrator with
author and storyteller [Gerald Hausman](http://www.wisdomtalespress.com/authors_artists-teens/Gerald_Hausman.shtml) to produce
the award\-winning Wisdom Tales book: [*The Otter, the Spotted Frog \& the Great
Flood*](http://www.wisdomtalespress.com/books/childrens_books/978-1-937786-12-0-15-1-The_Otter_the_Spotted_Frog_and_the_Great_Flood.shtml); a mythical story based in America before humans existed
on earth, with animal characters and a great flood that ends with the creation
of First Man and First Woman in a very surprising way. The book has won three
Midwest Book Awards (Gold Medal in the category “Illustration: Graphic,” and
Silver Medals in the categories “Children’s Picture Books” and “Total Book
Design”) and won the 2013 ForeWord Review “Book of the Year” Bronze Medal Award
in the category “Picture Books, Early Reader.”

Ramon’s collaborative nature has broadened his
accomplishments and continues to positively influence others.  Notable works have included: acclaimed Storytelling
at planetariums, fairs, museums, comedy venues; documentarian in music
journalism; graphic novel illustrations; creator and contributor to various
expressions such as “Guidance Through an Illustrative Alphabet”, “The
Corn Whisperer”, multicultural magazine titled “ColorsNW”, “THE ALPHABET
MONOLOGUES, multimedia experience “Star Story Sessions”, “The Art of Comedy
Collection” at the Hollywood Improv, “Pathways to Freedom 2000: A Trail of
Tears” for Rosa Parks and her associated influences, “Young Native Voices
Theater Education Project” at Red Eagle Soaring Youth Theater; hosting a Chef’s
Table at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of The American Indian in Washington
DC; and more.  

The collective
influence of these experiences with incredible mentors, communities, perspectives,
initiatives, and stories has shaped Shiloh’s worldview.  They continually teach him how to better
bridge the urban\-native gap from social commentary to realized action.  He is defined by his contributions of
productive thought, perspectives, Storytelling, art for our souls, food for our
bodies, grace of the written word, boundless love, and so much more.  Shiloh’s goal is to honor his life’s path, as
well as the legacy of June’s work, and continue
building better partnerships of understanding the Native way. 

 

Look out for his upcoming telling of Constellation Stories through his creation
“Star Stories for Little Dreamers.”

 “I reflect knowledge and observations of Native life

With respect and dignity to All”
