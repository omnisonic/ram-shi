It’s an honor to announce, I teamed with a Portland Oregon organization called Nesika Wilamut.  The goal is to weave visual narratives that impacts health concerns, and restorative efforts to our waterways within, and throughout the Willamette River. The title of this initiative is called: "Within Our Reach”WHO WE ARE

Nesika Wilamut Indigenous Advisory Council:

Nesika Wilamut, which means “Our Willamette'' in the Chinuk Wawa trade language, seeks to bring together restoration professionals, tribes, community members, scientists, public agencies, landowners, funders, and more to collaborate on Willamette River restoration and community connection to the River. 

The board of Nesika Wilamut envisions a network that centers the voices of Indigenous people, and as such has secured funding through Seeding Justice's Since Time Immemorial grant to create an Indigenous advisory council that will provide leadership and guidance to the network that Nesika Wilamut endeavors to bring together.

“We are an evolving, community\-driven network that weaves together people and communities who care about human and ecological well\-being in the Willamette River Basin. Join us!”
