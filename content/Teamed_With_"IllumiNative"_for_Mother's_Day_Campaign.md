She reflects in the brilliance of diversity (flower) with no bias or judgment. In this act, she is rewarded with a memory (necklace/medallion) of her innocence and for the time of her life. She is the promise of her generation, the hope. Instilled in this child are the qualities of respect, tolerance, strength, equality, and understanding, this is her birth right. These teachings have been passed down through all generations. She has the honor of harmony with Mother Earth and therefore a desire to protect us all. In her transformation, as a young adult, she reflects on herself (dancer) flourishing between tradition and modern society. She is the bridge. Her markings, worn to face the world, represent the challenges to be heard and a constant fight for respect as an independent woman. She continues this journey throughout her coming years. In the end, or beginning, her culmination of experiences is represented by the mother of all women (elder) who guides in purity and kindness. She watches over us and the generations to come so that we all can live a better life. For more information about IllumiNative go to \-\-\-\>[ILLUMINATIVE](https://illuminatives.org/)
