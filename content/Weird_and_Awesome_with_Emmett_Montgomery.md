Sunday April 3rd, I participated in a variety show at the beloved Annex Theater in Seattle. The show was called "Weird and Awesome with Emmett Montgomery" A variety show of skits, musical acts and serious monologues. Emmett has a way of distorting the absurd thru humor and I love that.   
Collective acts were: Rick Taylor, Derek Sheen, Rodney Sherwood, Barbara Holm, Travis Vogt, Kevin Clarke and Paul West . 
  
My performance was a monologue from my “Guidance Through an Illustrative Alphabet” book. A PowerPoint slideshow of each letter in 15 minutes. Two of my fav Seattle Musicians to accompanied my spoken word: Lbd Blkknight on Bass and David Levin on Cajon. I couldn’t have asked for a better duo to support my segment of the show. 
It was awesome. And already, I’m planning a one\-man show in the near future. Check out the Annex Theater @ <http://www.annextheatre.org/>
